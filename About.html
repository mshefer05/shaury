            <h2>Hello, <h2>
<p>
<p>I'm Mussa Rajabu Shauri, a content producer, writer, editor, comms expert, systems thinker, and occasional panellist / public speaker / moderator. </p>

<p>I try to make sense of the world through words, data, imagery, and other creative formats â€” anything that clarifies the chaos and connects with a desired audience.  </p>

<p>My subject specialties includes social media trends like football, sustainability, climate, ESG, just transition, oceans and the blue economy, cities, food, film and tv, and cannabis (to name just a few). </p>

<p> I am iterested with social media trends and this pushed me to take a bachelor degree in iformation technology at the National Institute of Transport(NIT), which I am done with it 2023.</p>

<p>Throughout that time I used to write some contents for leisure making jokes at different social media trends and educate as well through social medias like whatsapp groups, tweeter and instagram.</p>
<p>                                                                                                 </p>
<p>Now I'm here for your writing/editing/content production/comms needs.</p>

 <p>                                                                   </p>

<p>Let's work together! ðŸ¤“ðŸ’š</p></p>
